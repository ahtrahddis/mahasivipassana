# Resources for Mahasi Sayadaw's book "The Manual of Insight"

## About the book

[The Manual of Insight](http://mahasimanualofinsight.org/) is the most comprehensive guide for the practice of Mahasi Vipassana (Insight) meditation.

It is considered to be the magnus opus of [Mahasi Sayadaw]({{< ref "bio.md" >}}) and it is a must read - *or even better a must study* - for practicioners that want to go deeper in Mahasi Vipassana.

**Chapter 5** of this book is the most easily understandable and practical how-to for Mahasi Sayadaw's famous **noting technique**. The exact same text but with an older English translation, can also be found on this website by pressing these links:

- [Practical Insight Meditation: Basic Practice]({{< ref "practical-insight-meditation-basic-practice.md" >}})
- [Practical Insight Meditation: Progressive Practice]({{< ref "practical-insight-meditation-progressive-practice.md" >}})


In **Chapter 6**, Mahasi Sayadaw provides an extended analysis on the stages (map) of the progress of insight.

For further information about this map, please read ["The Progress of Insight Map"]({{< ref "the-progress-of-insight-map.md" >}}).

### George Haas Podcast

[George Haas](https://www.mettagroup.org/about/) has created a 47 episode (in fact 45, as 2 of them deal with a different subject) podcast about (a part of ) the "Manual of Insight" named [Deepening Your Practice (DYP)](https://www.mettagroup.org/podcast/2016/6/15/episode-1-manual-of-insight-introduction). 

**Note:** George Haas (a student of Shinzen Young) does not teach Mahasi Vipassana. His approach is based on a mixture of Metta/Vipassana techniques. His podcast deals with both the "Manual of Insight" book analysis and his own meditation method. 

At the end of each lecture you may find meditation instructions that are not related with Mahasi Sayadaw's famous noting technique.
