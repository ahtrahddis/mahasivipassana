# Resources for Mahasi Sayadaw's book "The Manual of Insight"

## About the book

[The Manual of Insight](http://mahasimanualofinsight.org/) is the most comprehensive manual for the practice of Mahasi Vipassana (Insight) meditation.

It is considered to be the magnus opus of [Mahasi Sayadaw]({{< ref "bio.md" >}}) and it is a must read - *or even better a must study* - for practicioners interested in Mahasi Vipassana.

**Chapter 5** of this book is the most easily understandable and practical guide for Mahasi Sayadaw's famous **noting technique**. The exact same text but with an older English translation, can also be found on this website by pressing this links:

This map is just a simplified version (created by MVMR) of Steve Armstrong's map included in the "Abhidhamma Reference Tables".

### Abhidhamma Reference Tables by Steve Armstrong

The following tables were originally designed by [Steve Armstrong](http://vipassanametta.org/wp/teachers/) in 1987-88. They are currently a part of the Appendix of "The Manual of Insight" by Wisdom Publications. 

Appendix 1 is the **"Progress of Insight" map**, as covered in book's chapter 6.

### Steve Armstrong's "The Map of the Journey" lecture

In July 21th of 2016, [Steve Armstrong](http://vipassanametta.org/wp/teachers/) gave a lecture in Seattle Insight Meditation Center, regarding the progress of insight as presented in Mahasi Sayadaw's "Manual of Insight". Below you will find a link to the video:

### George Haas Podcast

[George Haas](https://www.mettagroup.org/about/) has created a 47 episode (in fact 45, as 2 of them deal with a different subject) podcast about (a part of ) the "Manual of Insight" named [Deepening Your Practice (DYP)](https://www.mettagroup.org/podcast/2016/6/15/episode-1-manual-of-insight-introduction). 

**Note:** George Haas (a student of Shinzen Young) does not teach Mahasi Vipassana, instead his approach is based on a  mixture of Metta/Vipassana techniques. His podcast deals with both the "Manual of Insight" book analysis and his own meditation method. 

At the end of each lecture you may find meditation instructions that are not related with Mahasi Sayadaw's famous noting technique.
