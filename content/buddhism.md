# Buddhism Resources


Although practicing **Mahasi** (noting) **Vipassana** (Insight) Meditation does not require a Buddhist background, it's true that it's tightly connected with (Theravada) Buddhist tradition and philosophy.

If you are not familiar with Buddhism, below you will find some useful resources for beginners.

Please note that the person (*who is heavily influenced by the [Pragmatic Dharma Movement](https://alohadharma.com/2015/11/03/what-is-pragmatic-dharma/))* behind this website does not follow any specific Buddhist tradition, thus all the suggestions below cover a wide range of Buddhism variations and teachings.
