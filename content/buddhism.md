# Buddhism Resources


Although practicing **Mahasi (noting) Vipassana (Insight) Meditation** does not require a Buddhist background, it's true that it's tightly connected with (Theravada) Buddhist tradition and philosophy.

If you don't know about Buddhism and you desire to get started, below you will find some useful resources.

Please note that the person behind this website does not follow any specific Buddhist tradition, thus all the suggestions below cover a wide range of Buddhism variations.
