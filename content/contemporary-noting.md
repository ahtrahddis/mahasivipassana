# Contemporary Noting Techniques

Mahasi noting technique has inspired various contemporary meditation teachers, who have created their own alterations. Below you may the most popular ones.

## Kenneth Folk's Detailed (freestyle) noting

Based on Kenneth Folk's [text about this technique](http://kennethfolkdharma.com/2016/08/detailed-noting-is-better/):

> When doing noting practice, preferably aloud, you have to decide whether to do a very detailed noting or a more sparse or skeletal noting. A skeletal noting technique, for example, would be to just choose from these six notes: seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, smelling, and thinking.
> 
> Detailed noting, however, is better than skeletal noting. That’s because detailed noting “uses up” the available processing power of your mind, and that is exactly what you want to do. If you are noting in a way that requires all of your attention, your mind will not wander and you will not suffer. It’s that simple. If, on the other hand, you use a noting technique that only requires 30% of the processing power of your mind, what are you going to do with the other 70%? You’re going to suffer! Try it and see!
