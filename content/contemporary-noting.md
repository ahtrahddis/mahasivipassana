# Contemporary Noting Techniques

Mahasi noting technique has inspired various contemporary meditation teachers, who have created their own alterations. Below you may find the most popular ones.

## Kenneth Folk's Detailed (Freestyle) Noting

Based on Kenneth Folk's [text about this technique](http://kennethfolkdharma.com/2016/08/detailed-noting-is-better/):

> When doing noting practice, preferably aloud, you have to decide whether to do a very detailed noting or a more sparse or skeletal noting. A skeletal noting technique, for example, would be to just choose from these six notes: seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, smelling, and thinking.
> 
> Detailed noting, however, is better than skeletal noting. That’s because detailed noting “uses up” the available processing power of your mind, and that is exactly what you want to do. If you are noting in a way that requires all of your attention, your mind will not wander and you will not suffer. It’s that simple. If, on the other hand, you use a noting technique that only requires 30% of the processing power of your mind, what are you going to do with the other 70%? You’re going to suffer! Try it and see!

## Daniel Ingram's Fast Noting

Excerpts from Nicolai Halay's [article on thehamiltonproject.blogspot.com](https://thehamiltonproject.blogspot.com/p/contact-details.html):

In his book, [Mastering the Core Teachings of Buddha](https://www.mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents), Daniel Ingram gave an analogy for his style of noting called “shooting aliens”. Essentially it is a very fast style of noting that could entail noting as fast as once or twice per second or even more. I would note up to 3 times per second. When passing through specific stages of insight, I began to note with what Daniel Ingram called “mental taps” like “dat, dat”. I would often mentally tap a phenomenon that had been noticed with the mental note “hm, hm”. This way, I could notice and note a lot distinct phenomena of mind or body per second. This would be very stage specific when the mind felt like it had sped up and was able to register more phenomena than usual. In my experience, the 4th, 5th and 11th stage of insight would usually entail noting very fast like this.

He goes on to describe how “the speed, precision and playful attitude required for video games is exactly like the feel of well-done insight practices. If you watch some kid playing a fast alien-shooting game, you will notice that they are really going for it. They are shooting very fast and definitely not thinking about anything but doing that. This is exactly the sort of dedication and passion that helps with insight practices." 

Having this analogy of “shooting aliens” gave the sense that I had to always be alert for anything that presented itself to awareness in each and every moment. Whatever it was, I needed to notice then note it without pause. Over time, this style seemed to heighten my sensitivity to all the mental and physical phenomena that arose to take centre stage in the moment. I felt like a cowboy with his six shooters always at the ready, on alert for any trouble. 

Daniel Ingram explains that “when our mindfulness and investigation are on hair trigger, being aware of every little sensation that arises and passes, we are bound to win sooner or later. The motto, “Note first, ask questions later,” is just so helpful if we are to keep practicing precisely without getting lost in the stories."

### Criticism of Fast Noting

[Bikkhu Anālayo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhikkhu_Analayo) on [Meditation Maps, Attainment Claims, and the Adversities of Mindfulness](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-020-01389-4) *(you can read it for free [here](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s12671-020-01389-4?sharing_token=QU2HkVicBePIf9enJ0tt5_e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY47x1VhedA-AEnhCxOme0OeovhpGnOC3knuIuO6FN8vuUli00-N35lT8UKCMzDL77uziXm-hXd-UkXpkfeORz7yEWmycgculmjmMmv6FwsSlg2Rxwzi6xev4h5zLjcNUXY%3D))* stated:

> ....Fast noting can easily proceed from noting what has just appeared, to what is just appearing, to what is just about to appear, to what one expects to be just about to appear. From this point onward, the act of noting can actually serve to create experience, even without the practitioner consciously noting that (pun intended). Combined with an aggressive type of mindfulness that is comparable with shooting aliens, such practice can turn into a construction of meditative experiences rather than being an insightful observation of what happens naturally. Due to the mind being so busy noting in quick succession, the construction of meditative experience to conform to sup-posed insight knowledges and even levels of awakening will not be noticed. Having trained oneself to create these experiences during formal meditation, the same easily continues during daily life. This explains the idea that the insight knowledges can be experienced in any situation, even when watching tv....
