# About

## Website software
[MVMR]({{< ref "_index.md" >}}) was created using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) along with [hugo book  theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book). 

<br>
## Sources

You can browse [MVMR]({{< ref "_index.md" >}}) sources [on Github] (https://github.com/xmvmr/mahasivipassana).

[All texts](https://github.com/xmvmr/mahasivipassana/tree/master/content/docs) were written using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). 

<br>
## E-books

All e-books offered on [MVMR]({{< ref "_index.md" >}}) were based on freely distributed material whose publishing terms allowed redistribution.

### Software

For the creation of the e-books, **markdown** files (they are provided too) were converted to **EPUB** using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

Metadata handling and **EPUB** to **AZW3**/**MOBI** (both of them for kindle devices) conversion were done using [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).

**AZW3** (kindle) files were further processed using [Hyphenate This!](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=208534)
