# Welcome to Mahasi Vipassana Meditation Resources (MVMR)

On this website you will find all the needed information in order to learn the practice of **Vipassana (Insight) meditation**, as taught by Venerable [Mahasi Sayadaw]({{< ref "bio.md" >}}).

**Mahasi Vipassana** meditation technique is widely known as **"Mahasi noting"**.


## How to use this website

It is highly suggested to **read all the included Mahasi material**, as this will help you understand in depth the fundamentals of his famous Vipassana meditation **noting technique**.

However, if you want to learn the basics in order to get going with your meditation practice, you can:

1. Read: 
	- [Practical Vipassana meditation exercises]({{< ref "practical-vipassana-meditation-exercises.md" >}}), which is the shortest introduction to noting **or**
	- [Practical Insight Meditation: Basic Practice]({{< ref "ractical-insight-meditation-basic-practice.md" >}}), which is the most popular text by Mahasi Sayadaw

2. Read the [Q&A with Mahasi Sayadaw]({{< ref "mahasi-q&a.md" >}})

3. Watch the suggested material in the [Videos section]({{< ref "videos.md" >}}).


**Note:** Most of the [Mahasi Sayadaw]({{< ref "bio.md" >}}) texts found on MVMR, are **offered in downloadable e-book (epub/mobi/azw3) formats** for easier offline reading.

## What to read next




Although the material provided on this website is more than enough to get you started, if you want to have a deeper knowledge of Mahasi Vipassana, you should definitely read his book [The Manual of Insight]({{< ref "the-manual-of-insight.md" >}}).

&nbsp;
## Note

The person behind [MVMR]({{< ref "_index.md" >}}) is far from being considered an expert in Mahasi Vipassana or Buddhism in general and thus is unable to provide any guidance or advice.

This website was created **by a beginner** and is nothing more than a "personal notebook" published online, aiming to be a helpful resource for other people around the world with the same interest in insight meditation.
