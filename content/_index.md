# Welcome to Mahasi Vipassana Meditation Resources (MVMR)

On this website you will find all the information needed in order to learn the basics of **Vipassana (Insight) meditation** as taught by Venerable [Mahasi Sayadaw]({{< ref "bio.md" >}}).

**Mahasi Vipassana** meditation technique is widely known as **"Mahasi noting"**.


<br>
## How to use this website

It is highly suggested to **read all included Mahasi material**, as this will help you understand in depth the fundamentals of his famous Vipassana meditation **noting technique**.

However, if you only want to learn the basics in order to immediately start with your meditation practice, you can:

- Read [Practical Insight Meditation: Basic Practice]({{< ref "practical-insight-meditation-basic-practice.md" >}})

- Read the [Q&A with Mahasi Sayadaw]({{< ref "mahasi-q&a.md" >}})


- Watch the material suggested in the [Videos section]({{< ref "videos.md" >}}).

<br>
**Note:** Most of the texts by [Mahasi Sayadaw]({{< ref "bio.md" >}}) included in MVMR are **offered in e-book formats** for easier offline reading.


<br>
## What to read next

Although the material provided by MVMR is more than enough to get you started, if you want to have a deeper knowledge of Mahasi Vipassana, you should definitely read his book [The Manual of Insight]({{< ref "the-manual-of-insight.md" >}}).


<br>
## Note

The person behind [MVMR]({{< ref "_index.md" >}}) is far from being considered an expert in Mahasi Vipassana or Buddhism in general and thus is unable to provide any guidance or advice.

This website was created **by a beginner** and is nothing more than a "personal notebook" published online, aiming to be a helpful resource for other people around the world with the same interest in insight meditation.
