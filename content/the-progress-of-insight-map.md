## Download The map

## Visuddhimagga - The Path of Purification

Mahasi Sayadaw based his analysis of the PoI stages on Visuddhimagga, a Theravada Buddhist doctrine, written by Buddhagosha approximately in the 5th Century.

You can download **Visuddhimagga** in various e-book formats, using the following link:

## Modern interpretations of the map

The Pragmatic Dharma community is heavily influenced by both Mahasi Sayadaw's noting technique and his analysis on the stages of progress of Insight. Below you will find some alternative interpretations of PoI (**P**rogress **o**f **I**nsight) map by three famous pragmatic dharma teachers:

- [Part IV: Insight](http://mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents/part-iv-insight/30-the-progress-of-insight/) from [Mastering the core teachings of the Buddha](http://mctb.org) by [Daniel Ingram](http://integrateddaniel.info/)

- [The progress of insight map](https://eudoxos.github.io/cfitness/html/cfitness.html#the-progress-of-insight-map) from [Contemplative Fitness](https://eudoxos.github.io/cfitness/html/index.html) by [Kenneth Folk](https://kennethfolkdharma.com/)

- [The Path](https://alohadharma.com/the-map/), [The Physio-COgnitive Stage](https://alohadharma.com/the-map/the-physio-cognitive-stage/), [The A&P](https://alohadharma.com/2011/06/04/the-ap/), [The Dark Night](https://alohadharma.com/2011/06/12/the-dark-night/), [Equanimity](https://alohadharma.com/2011/06/21/equanimity/), [Cessation](https://alohadharma.com/2011/06/29/cessation/) from [Aloha Dharma](https://github.com/atrahhdis/alohadharma/) by [Ron Crouch](https://alohadharma.com/about/)


A combination of the texts by Kenneth Folk and Ron Crouch can be downloaded in various e-book formats using the following link:

### Videos by Daniel Ingram

Daniel Ingram has published various videos on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/user13532867) regarding the PoI stages:

- [Ñana Graph Video](https://vimeo.com/69793499)
- [Ñana and Jhana Mind Map Explained](https://vimeo.com/69475208)
- [The Arising and Passing Away, A Short Rant](https://vimeo.com/317384445)

<br>
### Note

Although the [Pragmatic Dharma Movement](https://alohadharma.com/2015/11/03/what-is-pragmatic-dharma/) is heavily influenced by Mahasi Sayadaw's work, Daniel Ingram, Kenneth Folk and Ron Crouch are not (at least publicly) authorized teachers in Mahasi Sayadaw's lineage.

It is true that the Pragmatic Dharma Teachers suggest a new and for some a controversial approach on the Buddha's teachings. People interested in the Mahasi Vipassana and the stages of the PoI are encouraged to study this material and come to their own conclusions.
