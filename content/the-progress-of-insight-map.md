## Modern interpretations of the map

The Pragmatic Dharma community is heavily influenced by both Mahasi Sayadaw's noting technique and his analysis on the stages of PoI. Below you will find some alternative interpretations of the PoI map by three famous pragmatic dharma teachers:

- [Part IV: Insight](https://mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents/part-iv-insight/30-the-progress-of-insight/) from [Mastering the core teachings of the Buddha](https://mctb.org) by [Daniel Ingram](https://integrateddaniel.info/)

- [The progress of insight map](https://eudoxos.github.io/cfitness/html/cfitness.html#the-progress-of-insight-map) from [Contemplative Fitness](https://eudoxos.github.io/cfitness/html/index.html) by [Kenneth Folk](https://kennethfolkdharma.com/)

- [The Path](https://alohadharma.com/the-map/), [The Physio-Cognitive Stage](https://alohadharma.com/the-map/the-physio-cognitive-stage/), [The A&P](https://alohadharma.com/2011/06/04/the-ap/), [The Dark Night](https://alohadharma.com/2011/06/12/the-dark-night/), [Equanimity](https://alohadharma.com/2011/06/21/equanimity/), [Cessation](https://alohadharma.com/2011/06/29/cessation/) from [Aloha Dharma](https://alohadharma.com) by [Ron Crouch](https://alohadharma.com/about/)

&nbsp;
### Videos by Daniel Ingram

Daniel Ingram has published various videos on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/user13532867) regarding the PoI stages:

- [Ñana Graph Video](https://vimeo.com/69793499)
- [Ñana and Jhana Mind Map Explained](https://vimeo.com/69475208)
- [The Arising and Passing Away, A Short Rant](https://vimeo.com/317384445)
- [Diagnosing Stream Entry](https://vimeo.com/372228348)
- [Cessation Diagnosis with snow](https://vimeo.com/378891278)

&nbsp;
### Note

Although the [Pragmatic Dharma Movement](https://alohadharma.com/2015/11/03/what-is-pragmatic-dharma/) is heavily influenced by Mahasi Sayadaw's work, Daniel Ingram ( D. Ingram is [supposedly authorized](http://web.archive.org/web/20070917070818/http://www.bswa.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=2216&forum=7&viewmode=flat&order=ASC&start=20) to teach the Dhamma by Sayadaw U Pandita, Jr.), Kenneth Folk and Ron Crouch are not (at least publicly) authorized teachers in the Mahasi Sayadaw's lineage.

It is true that the Pragmatic Dharma teachers suggest a new, practice oriented and for some a controversial approach on the teachings of the Buddha. Practitioners interested in Mahasi Vipassana and the stages of the PoI are encouraged to study this material and come to their own conclusions.
